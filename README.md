# Programming Quotes

## Brief description
This project is developed to participate in the [Flutter Create Contest](https://flutter.dev/create). In the application, you can read quotes of great different people. If you feel you need a piece of advice - this app can give a motivation to develop yourself!

### Available features:
- Show approx. 400 wise thoughts from engineers, scientists, etc;
- Like quotes;
- Show different images in a background;
- Share quotes with others;
- Left and right swipes are supported.

### More facts:
- On a startup application, a random sequence of quotes was built. You can go forward or back along this sequence. If you scroll quickly, you can come back and read more carefully or like a quote.
- All liked quotes saved in the separate list, and available after closing the application.
- There is a button between switching lists of quotes you liked and not yet.
- The background image changes once in 9 shifts of quotes. Value of blur each time occurs randomly: the sigma parameter is selected from 1 to 6 for both axes.
- 30 different images are available in total. Images are taken from the site https://unsplash.com by computers, technologies topics.
- Quotes are taken from different sources available online.
- Font size is scaled by the length of the quote to fit the screen size.

According to the contest rules, all source code size must be less than 5KB. I'm didn't use 'dartfmt' here, so there is a tradeoff between code quality and available functionality.
